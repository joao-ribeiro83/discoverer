# Fastify Better Auth Bridge

## When to Use

Load this skill for: the user asks to "bridge Better Auth into Fastify", "fix Fastify session resolution", "forward auth cookies", "patch IDCS org context", or "decorate Fastify request auth".

Prefer this skill only for its named domain. For broader OCI architecture triage, start with `oci/best-practices` as the router.

Wire Better Auth session resolution into Fastify 5 via the `onRequest` hook. Use this when Better Auth already exists but Fastify lacks the framework bridge.

## Do NOT load this skill when

- The problem is callback URL configuration, trusted origins, or provider bootstrap order
- The problem is IDCS group mapping or `org_members` provisioning rules
- The goal is to build a parallel session system alongside Better Auth

## NEVER

- Never build a parallel session layer when cookie header forwarding is all that's needed — the symptom (no session) and the fix (forward cookies) are separated by two layers, making it easy to misdiagnose.
- Never enforce RBAC policy inside the bridge `onRequest` hook — the bridge resolves identity, route guards enforce access. Mixing them makes both untestable.
- Never share mutable array decorator defaults in Fastify 5 — arrays on the prototype are shared across all requests; use a Symbol-backed getter/setter per-request.
- Never skip the Web `Request` bridge — `auth.api.getSession()` requires a native Web API `Request`, not a Fastify request object. Passing the wrong type silently returns no session.
- Never assume `reply.send(undefined)` is safe in Fastify 5 — it throws.

## The Non-Obvious Parts

### Why cookie forwarding breaks silently

Missing cookie headers make login and session resolution fail in completely different places — the login succeeds (sets cookie in browser) but the next request has no session. There's no error; the session is simply `null`. The bridge and the login flow look unrelated. Always verify cookies are included in the Web `Request` you build.

### Why Fastify 5 decorator arrays share state

`fastify.decorateRequest('permissions', [])` — the `[]` is a prototype default shared across all requests. First request mutates it; second request sees the previous request's permissions. Use a Symbol-keyed getter/setter that allocates a fresh array per request.

### Why IDCS users have no active org

IDCS-provisioned users are created via group sync, not Better Auth's organization-switch flow. Their session has no `activeOrganizationId`. Downstream code expecting org context will silently receive `undefined`. Patch by querying `org_members` when `activeOrganizationId` is absent.

## Required Bridge Shape

**Step 1: Web `Request` bridge**
Build from protocol + hostname + URL + method + full incoming headers. The headers must include `cookie` — that's the only way `auth.api.getSession()` can resolve a session.

**Step 2: Decorate request state once**
Standardize: `request.user`, `request.session`, `request.permissions`, `request.apiKeyContext`. Use Symbol-backed getter/setter for any field that holds an array or mutable object.

**Step 3: Path exclusions**
Skip session resolution only for: health, metrics, Better Auth handler routes. Normalize query strings and trailing slashes before matching — inconsistent normalization creates auth misses on some routes only.

**Step 4: Resolve session, then continue as anonymous on error**
If `auth.api.getSession()` throws: log it, continue with `request.user = null`. Never reject the request at bridge level — that's the route guard's job.

**Step 5: Patch org context**
If `request.session.activeOrganizationId` is absent, query `org_members` by user ID and set the org context downstream. Only do this when org context is genuinely absent — not as a default fallback on every request.

## Diagnostic Script

```bash
node scripts/check-fastify-auth-bridge.js /path/to/auth-plugin.ts
# Defaults to apps/api/src/plugins/auth.ts if no argument given
```

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS`: Optional path to the Fastify auth plugin file to inspect. Empty = use repo-default path (`apps/api/src/plugins/auth.ts`).
