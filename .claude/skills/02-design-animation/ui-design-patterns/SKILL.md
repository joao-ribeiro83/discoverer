# UI Design Patterns

> Source: https://github.com/dirnbauer/webconsulting-skills

Practical guidelines for creating polished, professional user interfaces without relying on graphic design talent. These patterns work for any web project, including TYPO3 frontend development.

## Acknowledgements

These patterns are adapted from two excellent resources:

- **Refactoring UI** by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger — The definitive guide to practical UI design for developers
- **Practical UI** (2nd Edition) by Adham Dannaway — Quick and practical UI design guidelines for intuitive, accessible, and beautiful interfaces

We highly recommend both works for deepening your UI design knowledge.

## 0. Core Principles (from Practical UI)

Before diving into specific patterns, internalize these foundational principles:

### Minimize Usability Risks

Base design decisions on risk assessment—the risk that someone could have difficulty using an interface:

- Light grey text may look sleek but risks readability issues
- Icons without labels risk confusion about meaning
- Colored heading text risks being mistaken for links

**Always consider:** people with poor eyesight, low computer literacy, reduced dexterity, and cognitive differences.

### Have a Logical Reason for Every Design Detail

Every UI element should have a rationale. "That looks nice" is not constructive feedback. Be able to articulate *why* each design decision was made.

| Element | Logical Reason |
|---------|----------------|
| Left-aligned text | Creates neat edge, improves readability |
| Descriptive headings | Scannable, works with screen readers |
| Blue underlined links | Indicates interactivity, accessible for color blind |
| Grouped spacing | Related items closer together reduce cognitive load |

### Minimize Interaction Cost

Interaction cost = physical + mental effort to complete a task. Reduce it by:

1. **Keep related actions close** (Fitts's Law—closer/larger targets are faster to click)
2. **Reduce distractions** (avoid attention-grabbing elements that pull focus)
3. **Use progressive disclosure** (reveal complexity only when needed)

### Minimize Cognitive Load

Cognitive load is the mental effort required to use an interface. Reduce it by:

- Breaking information into smaller, digestible chunks
- Using familiar patterns people already understand
- Removing unnecessary elements and decisions
- Grouping related items visually

### Design System First

Create a system of reusable guidelines before designing:

- Color palette with usage rules
- Typography scale
- Spacing system
- Component patterns
- Interaction states

This ensures consistency and speeds up decision-making.

### Accessibility is Non-Negotiable

Meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** at minimum:

| Requirement | Minimum Ratio |
|-------------|---------------|
| Small text (below large-text threshold) | 4.5:1 contrast |
| Large text (24px+/18pt regular or 18.66px+/14pt bold) | 3:1 contrast |
| UI elements (borders, icons) | 3:1 contrast |

**Never rely on color alone**—always pair with icons, patterns, or text for color blind users.

### Use Common Design Patterns

Per Jakob's Law, stick with patterns people already know:

- Conventional form fields (not custom/unfamiliar styles)
- Standard navigation patterns
- Expected icon meanings
- Familiar button behaviors

Save creativity for your product's unique value proposition, not basic UI conventions.

### The 80/20 Rule

Roughly 80% of users use 20% of features. Prioritize the common paths:

- Optimize for frequent tasks, not edge cases
- Focus design effort where it has the largest impact
- Don't over-engineer rarely-used features

---

## 1. Starting from Scratch

### Start with a Feature, Not a Layout

Don't begin by designing the shell (navigation, sidebar, footer). Start with actual functionality.

**Wrong approach:**
- "Should it have a top nav or sidebar?"
- "Where should the logo go?"

**Right approach:**
- Design the core feature first (search form, product card, user profile)
- The navigation will reveal itself as you design features

### Detail Comes Later

In early stages, ignore typefaces, shadows, and icons. Use thick markers or low-fidelity wireframes to explore layouts quickly.

### Hold the Color

Design in grayscale first. This forces you to use spacing, contrast, and size to create hierarchy. Color comes later as enhancement.

### Work in Cycles

1. Design a simple version of the next feature
2. Build it
3. Iterate on the working design
4. Move to the next feature

### Be a Pessimist

Design the smallest useful version first. Don't design features you can't build yet—ship what works.

## 2. Hierarchy is Everything

### Not All Elements Are Equal

Visual hierarchy makes interfaces feel "designed". When everything competes for attention, nothing stands out.

**The key:** Deliberately de-emphasize secondary and tertiary information while highlighting what matters most.

### Size Isn't Everything

Don't rely solely on font size for hierarchy. Use:

| Technique | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Font weight** | 600-700 for emphasis, 400-500 for normal |
| **Color contrast** | Dark for primary, grey for secondary, light grey for tertiary |
| **Spacing** | More space around important elements |

**Color guidelines for text:**
- Primary content: Dark color (e.g., `slate-900`)
- Secondary content: Medium grey (e.g., `slate-600`)
- Tertiary content: Light grey (e.g., `slate-400`)

### Don't Use Grey Text on Colored Backgrounds

Grey text on colored backgrounds looks washed out. Instead, pick a color with the same hue as the background, adjusting saturation and lightness.

```css
/* Bad: Grey on blue background */
background: hsl(220, 80%, 50%);
color: #888888; /* Looks dull */

/* Good: Tinted text matching background hue */
background: hsl(220, 80%, 50%);
color: hsl(220, 60%, 85%); /* Harmonious and readable */
```

### Emphasize by De-emphasizing

If a primary element doesn't stand out, don't make it louder—make competing elements quieter.

```css
/* Instead of making active nav item bolder... */
/* ...make inactive items softer */
.nav-item { color: var(--slate-400); }
.nav-item.active { color: var(--slate-900); }
```

### Labels Are a Last Resort

Context often eliminates the need for labels:

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| "Email: john@example.com" | john@example.com (format is obvious) |
| "In stock: 12" | "12 left in stock" |
| "Bedrooms: 3" | "3 bedrooms" |

When labels are necessary, de-emphasize them—the data is what matters.

### Balance Weight and Contrast

Heavy elements (icons, bold text) can be de-emphasized with softer colors. Light elements (thin borders) can be emphasized with increased weight.

```css
/* Icon feels too heavy? Reduce contrast */
.icon { color: var(--slate-400); } /* Instead of slate-900 */

/* Border too subtle? Increase width */
border: 2px solid hsl(210, 23%, 95%); /* Instead of 1px darker */
```

### Button Hierarchy

Design buttons based on hierarchy, not just semantics:

| Type | Style | Use for |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Primary** | Solid, high contrast | Main action on page |
| **Secondary** | Outline or lower contrast | Less important actions |
| **Tertiary** | Link style | Seldom-used actions |

**Destructive actions** aren't automatically red and bold. If "Delete" isn't the primary action, style it as secondary or tertiary, then use bold red styling in the confirmation modal.

## 3. Layout and Spacing

### Start with Too Much White Space

Begin with excessive space, then remove until satisfied. This ensures elements breathe properly.

### Establish a Spacing System

Use a constrained scale with meaningful jumps (~25% between values):

```
4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 96px, 128px
```

**Base on 16px** (default browser font size, divides nicely).

### You Don't Have to Fill the Screen

If content only needs 600px, don't stretch it to 1200px. Extra space around edges never hurts.

### Shrink the Canvas

Designing for mobile first often reveals better solutions. Start with ~400px width, then expand.

### Grids Are Overrated

Not all elements should be fluid. Sidebars, icons, and avatars often work better with fixed sizes while main content flexes.

```css
/* Better than percentage-based sidebar */
.sidebar { width: 280px; flex-shrink: 0; }
.main { flex: 1; min-width: 0; }
```

### Relative Sizing Doesn't Scale

Headlines shouldn't stay proportional to body text across screen sizes. Large elements should shrink faster than small ones on mobile.

```css
/* Desktop: 45px headline, 18px body (2.5x ratio) */
/* Mobile: 24px headline, 14px body (1.7x ratio) */
```

### Avoid Ambiguous Spacing

When elements are grouped without visible separators, the spacing between groups must be greater than spacing within groups.

```css
/* Form labels should be closer to their inputs than to previous inputs */
.form-group { margin-bottom: 24px; }
.form-label { margin-bottom: 8px; }
```
