# Plan Harder

## Goal

Produce a deeper implementation plan than a normal planning pass. Slow down,
reduce ambiguity, surface hidden risks, and leave behind a concrete plan that
is ready for careful execution.

Only create the plan. Do not implement the work.

## Planning-Only Contract

- Do not implement the work.
- Do not open PRs, mutate GitHub state, publish artifacts, or silently continue
  into coding after the plan.
- Repo writes are limited to the saved plan file under `plans/` unless the user
  explicitly asks for chat-only output.
- If the broader request includes later implementation, issue creation, or
  orchestration, finish the plan first and make the handoff explicit instead of
  blending phases together.

## Trigger Rules

- Use when the user explicitly invokes `plan-harder` or asks for a harder,
  deeper, or more stress-tested plan.
- Use when the task is ambiguous, high-risk, multi-phase, or likely to hide
  ordering problems or missing validation steps.
- Do not use for straightforward planning work that does not need an extra
  review pass.

## Output Mode

- Default: save the plan to `plans/<topic>-plan.md`.
- If the user explicitly says not to write a file, not to write Markdown, or
  to keep the plan in chat, return the plan in chat only and say that no file
  was saved.
- When the plan is meant to feed later implementation or GitHub issue creation,
  end with issue-sized work slices and a clear handoff note.

## Workflow

### 1. Research First

- Inspect the codebase, architecture, existing patterns, and nearby tests.
- Identify dependencies, edge cases, rollout concerns, and likely failure
  modes before drafting the plan.

### 2. Clarify High-Risk Unknowns

- Ask focused clarifying questions before drafting the plan when ambiguity
  could materially change the work.
- Ask only the minimum question batch needed to eliminate wrong plan branches.
- Prefer `request_user_input` when available.
- Respect the runtime limit of 1-3 questions per `request_user_input` call;
  if more clarification is needed, ask only the highest-signal next batch.
- If `request_user_input` is unavailable, ask the same focused questions in
  plain chat with concise numbered options and a recommended default.
- Prefer short numbered questions over paragraphs.
- Offer multiple-choice options when practical.
- Suggest reasonable defaults when appropriate.
- Include a fast-path reply such as `defaults` when the recommended choices are
  acceptable.
- Include a low-friction "not sure - use default" option when that meaningfully
  reduces back-and-forth.
- Do not ask questions that a quick, low-risk discovery read can answer from
  the repo, config, or nearby docs.
- Prioritize questions about:
  - scope and non-goals
  - success criteria
  - compatibility constraints
  - rollout/rollback expectations
  - validation expectations
- Use this underspecification checklist when deciding whether clarification is
  required before the plan is final:
  - the objective is unclear
  - "done" is unclear
  - scope boundaries are unclear
  - constraints are unclear
  - the target environment is unclear
  - safety or reversibility is unclear

### 3. Fetch Official Docs When Needed

- If the plan depends on external libraries, frameworks, APIs, or tools whose
  current behavior matters, fetch the relevant official documentation before
  finalizing tasks.
- Use the runtime's best official-doc path for the current environment rather
  than relying on memory when the detail is likely to drift.

### 4. Draft the Plan

Create a phased plan with:

- a short overview
- prerequisites
- logical sprints or phases
- atomic tasks with clear boundaries
- validation per task
- testing strategy
- risk and rollback notes

Each task should be:

- small enough to commit independently when practical
- specific about files or areas touched when known
- explicit about dependencies on earlier tasks
- testable or otherwise verifiable
- concrete about what "done" means

### 5. Save to `plans/` by Default

- In the current working directory, ensure a `plans/` directory exists.
- If it does not exist, create it before saving the plan.
- Save the generated plan to `plans/<topic>-plan.md`.
- Derive `<topic>` from the request using kebab-case.
- If the user explicitly asked for chat-only or no-file output, skip the write
  and keep the same structure in the returned plan.

Examples:

- `fix auth timeout bug` -> `plans/auth-timeout-bug-plan.md`
- `design a safer webhook retry flow` ->
  `plans/safer-webhook-retry-flow-plan.md`

### 6. Run a Gotcha Pass

- Re-read the saved plan and look for:
  - missing steps
  - missing dependencies
  - vague acceptance criteria
  - unsafe ordering
  - rollout or rollback gaps
  - missing validation
- If real gaps remain, ask the minimum follow-up questions needed and update
  the saved plan.

### 7. Review Before Returning

- Review the saved plan for:
  - missing dependencies
  - ordering failures
  - unhandled edge cases
  - vague or untestable tasks
- If explicit delegation is allowed in the current run, you may ask a subagent
  to perform this review. Tell the reviewer not to ask questions and to return
  only actionable feedback.
- Otherwise, perform the same review locally before returning.
- Incorporate useful review feedback into the saved plan before finishing.

# Plan: [Task Name]

**Generated**: [Date]
**Estimated Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]

## Overview
[Summary of the work and the recommended approach]

## Prerequisites
- [Dependencies or requirements]
- [Tools, libraries, access, or docs needed]

## Sprint 1: [Name]
**Goal**: [What this phase accomplishes]
**Demo/Validation**:
- [How to demo or verify the phase]

### Task 1.1: [Name]
- **Location**: [File paths or areas]
- **Description**: [What to do]
- **Complexity**: [1-10]
- **Dependencies**: [Earlier tasks or `None`]
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [Specific outcome]

```

## Output Expectations

- Return the final saved plan path, or explicitly say that the plan stayed in
  chat-only mode with no file written.
- Summarize the main phases, the riskiest assumptions, and any open questions
  that remain.
- If clarification was needed, restate the resolved interpretation before
  summarizing the plan.
- Include the explicit handoff boundary for any later implementation,
  orchestration, or GitHub follow-up.
- Do not implement the plan.

## Example Requests

- "Plan harder for this auth migration before we touch any code."
- "Give me a deeper, stress-tested implementation plan for this feature."
- "Make a harder plan for this refactor and save it under `plans/`."
