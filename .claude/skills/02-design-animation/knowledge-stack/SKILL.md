# Knowledge Stack

Nick's durable knowledge lives in two layers. Stored memory summaries are lossy; these are the real artifacts. Consult them before reasoning.

## The Split

**Per-repo dev work** → `backlog docs` and `backlog tasks` inside each repo.
- Architecture, product strategy, implementation plans, active priorities, roadmap notes.
- Consistent pattern across Nick's repos under `~/Developer/`.
- For CLI mechanics, see the `backlog-md` skill.

**Cross-cutting personal and career** → Basic Memory vault (via the `basic-memory` MCP).
- Job search pipeline, interview prep state, tax amendment, foreclosure/tenant situation, Hard Stuff drafts, brand and design work, strategic positioning.
- Obsidian is an optional UI, not required. The vault is plain markdown; any editor works.

**Ephemeral conversation context** → this chat. Promote to the right layer when worth keeping.

## Operational Rules

1. **Before reasoning about a specific repo**, run `backlog doc list` in that repo. Pull relevant docs with `backlog doc view <id>` before forming conclusions from stored memory.
2. **Before reasoning about cross-cutting work**, search Basic Memory (`search_notes`, then `read_note`) before reasoning from stored memory.
3. **When a chat surfaces something durable**, propose writing it to the right layer. Don't silently drop context.
4. **Don't duplicate content across layers.** If something could plausibly live in both, ask Nick which layer owns it.

## Failure Modes to Avoid

- Reasoning from stored memory summaries when fresher truth exists in backlog docs or the vault — produces stale or wrong answers.
- Writing to Basic Memory what belongs in a repo's backlog docs, or vice versa — produces knowledge drift across layers that compounds over time.
- Treating Obsidian as required — Nick doesn't want the Electron app running. The vault is markdown files; use whatever editor or the MCP directly.
- Enumerating "Nick's repos" from memory and getting it wrong — just `ls ~/Developer/` or check the current working directory.
