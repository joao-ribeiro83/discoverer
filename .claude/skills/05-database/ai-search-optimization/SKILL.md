# AI Search Optimization (AEO & GEO)

> Source: https://github.com/dirnbauer/webconsulting-skills

> **Scope:** Optimizing content for AI-powered search engines and answer engines
> This skill covers strategies for visibility in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Microsoft Copilot, and other generative AI platforms.

## 1. Understanding AEO & GEO

### What is AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)?

Answer Engine Optimization focuses on structuring content to provide **direct, concise answers** to user queries through AI-powered platforms. Unlike traditional SEO which aims for link clicks, AEO optimizes for being **cited as the answer source**.

**Target platforms:**
- Google AI Overviews (formerly SGE)
- Perplexity AI
- ChatGPT Search
- Microsoft Copilot Search
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)

### What is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)?

Generative Engine Optimization is the broader discipline of enhancing content visibility within **AI-generated search results**. It targets generative engines that synthesize answers from multiple sources rather than presenting traditional link lists.

**Key differences from traditional SEO:**

| Aspect | Traditional SEO | AEO/GEO |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Goal | Rank in SERPs | Be cited in AI answers |
| User behavior | Click through to site | Get answer directly |
| Content format | Keyword-optimized pages | Structured, citable content |
| Success metric | Click-through rate | Citation frequency |
| Query type | Short keywords | Conversational, long-tail |

### The AI Search Landscape (2025-2026)

- **Google AI Overviews:** 2B+ monthly users across 200 countries ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/))
- **Google AI Mode:** 100M+ monthly users in US and India
- **ChatGPT Search:** Real-time web search with citations
- **Perplexity AI:** Real-time citation engine, emphasis on freshness
- **Microsoft Copilot Search:** Bing integration with generative AI
- **Zero-click searches:** About 60% of global searches end without a click ([neotype.ai](https://neotype.ai/zeroclick-searches/))

## 2. Content Structure for AI Readability

### Semantic HTML Structure

AI systems extract information more effectively from well-structured content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Descriptive, Question-Answering Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <article>
        <header>
            <h1>Primary Topic as Question or Clear Statement</h1>
            <p class="summary">Direct 2-3 sentence answer to the main question.</p>
        </header>
        
        <main>
            <section>
                <h2>Subtopic Heading</h2>
                <p>Detailed explanation with facts and data.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Key point 1 with specific information</li>
                    <li>Key point 2 with verifiable data</li>
                    <li>Key point 3 with actionable insight</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
        </main>
        
        <aside>
            <h3>Quick Facts</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Term</dt>
                <dd>Definition</dd>
            </dl>
        </aside>
    </article>
</body>
</html>
```

### Heading Hierarchy Best Practices

```markdown
# H1: Main Topic (contains primary question/keyword)
   └── ## H2: Major subtopic
          └── ### H3: Specific aspect
                 └── #### H4: Details (use sparingly)
```

**Rules:**
- Single H1 per page
- H1 should answer "What is this page about?"
- Use question-format headings when appropriate
- Include target keywords naturally

### The Inverted Pyramid Pattern

Structure content for AI extraction:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     DIRECT ANSWER (First 1-2       │ ← AI extracts this
│     sentences answer the query)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│     KEY FACTS & CONTEXT            │ ← Supporting evidence
│     (Bullet points, data, quotes)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│     DETAILED EXPLANATION           │ ← Comprehensive coverage
│     (Background, methodology,       │
│      examples, case studies)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│     RELATED TOPICS                 │ ← Topic authority signals
│     (Links to related content)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Lists and Tables for Extraction

AI engines prefer structured data formats:

```html
<!-- Comparison Table -->
<table>
    <caption>Feature Comparison: Product A vs Product B</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Product A</th>
            <th>Product B</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Price</td>
            <td>$99/month</td>
            <td>$149/month</td>
        </tr>
        <!-- More rows -->
    </tbody>
</table>

<!-- Definition List for Terms -->
<dl>
    <dt>AEO</dt>
    <dd>Answer Engine Optimization - optimizing content for direct answers</dd>
    
    <dt>GEO</dt>
    <dd>Generative Engine Optimization - visibility in AI-generated results</dd>
</dl>

<!-- Step-by-Step Process -->
<ol>
    <li>Step one with clear action</li>
    <li>Step two with measurable outcome</li>
    <li>Step three with verification method</li>
</ol>
```

## 3. Schema Markup for AI Understanding

### Essential Schema Types

Research shows structured data significantly improves AI search visibility:

- Structured data helps machines parse and interpret your content; note that Google documents **no AI Overviews inclusion boost** from schema markup
- **Organization schema**: 2.8x increase in citation frequency
- **FAQPage schema**: 2.5x rise in answer inclusion
- **Article schema**: 2.2x boost in content citations
- Sites with 15+ schema types see **2.4x higher citation rates** ([surgeboom.com](https://surgeboom.com/research/structured-data-ai-citation-impact-study.html))

#### FAQPage Schema
