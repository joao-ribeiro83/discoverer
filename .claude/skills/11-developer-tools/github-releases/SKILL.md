# GitHub Releases

## Role

Handle release work with direct `git`, `gh release`, and registry/package
commands. This skill is scriptless by design.

Use this skill for release readiness, tag checks, generated notes, release
asset inspection, draft or published GitHub Releases, and package availability
confirmation.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the repository and default branch.
2. Inspect tags and existing releases before creating anything.
3. Compare the intended version against package manifests or changelog files.
4. Generate or review notes with `gh release view` and
   `gh release create --generate-notes` as appropriate.
5. After publishing, verify GitHub Release state and any package registry
   availability requested by the user.
