# OCI IAM and Identity Management - Expert Knowledge

## Do NOT load this skill when

Do not load this skill for unrelated general programming, non-Oracle cloud work, or questions covered by a narrower sibling skill.
When the request is only asking to find or install skills, use `find-skills` instead.

## When to Use

Load this skill for: the user asks to "write OCI IAM policy", "debug OCI 403", "Terraform apply gets 403", "configure dynamic groups", "use identity domains", or "fix IDCS federation".

Prefer this skill only for its named domain. For broader OCI architecture triage, start with `oci/best-practices` as the router.

## NEVER Do This

**NEVER use overly broad policies in production**
```
# WRONG - grants admin to everyone, instant security audit failure
Allow any-user to manage all-resources in tenancy

# RIGHT - explicit group, specific resource, specific compartment
Allow group AppDevelopers to manage instance-family in compartment AppDev
  where target.instance.name =~ 'dev-*'
```

**NEVER place policy in a child compartment when the target resource is in a parent**
```
# WRONG - policy in A/B/C cannot grant access to resources in A
Policy location: Compartment A/B/C
"Allow group X to read buckets in compartment A"  # Fails silently

# RIGHT - policy must be AT OR ABOVE the target compartment
Policy location: Compartment A (or root tenancy)
"Allow group X to read buckets in compartment A"
```
This is the single most common policy misconfiguration in OCI — no error is thrown, access just fails.

**NEVER use `any-user` in production policies**
- Grants access to ALL future users, including compromised accounts
- Always fails SOC2/HIPAA/CIS audits
- Use explicit group membership: `Allow group DataReaders to read buckets in compartment SharedData`

**NEVER grant access to instances using user principal syntax**
```
# WRONG - instances are NOT users
Allow user <instance-ocid> to read buckets in compartment X

# RIGHT - use dynamic groups for instances
Allow dynamic-group app-instances to read buckets in compartment X
```

**NEVER hardcode resource OCIDs in dynamic group rules**
```
# WRONG - breaks when instance is replaced
ALL {instance.id = 'ocid1.instance.oc1.phx.xxxxx'}

# RIGHT - use compartment or tag matching (survives instance replacement)
ALL {instance.compartment.id = '<compartment-ocid>'}
ANY {instance.freeform-tags.environment = 'production'}
```

## IAM Permission Troubleshooting

### "404 NotAuthorizedOrNotFound"

This error is intentionally ambiguous — OCI returns 404 whether the resource doesn't exist OR the caller lacks `inspect` permission. This prevents enumeration attacks.

```
404 NotAuthorizedOrNotFound?
│
├─ Does the resource definitely exist?
│  ├─ YES → Permission issue
│  │  └─ Does caller have at least 'inspect' on that resource type?
│  │  └─ Is policy at or above the target compartment?
│  └─ NO → Verify OCID, compartment, region
│
├─ Using dynamic group / instance principal?
│  └─ oci compute instance get --instance-id <ocid>  (check compartment + tags)
│  └─ Does instance's compartment/tags match the dynamic group rule?
│
└─ Cross-compartment access?
   └─ Policy must be in the compartment containing BOTH source and target
      OR in root (tenancy)
```

### "403 NotAuthorized"

Caller is identified but explicitly lacks permission.

**Common causes:**
1. **Wrong verb**: Policy grants `read` but action requires `use` or `manage`
2. **Wrong resource-type**: Granted `instance-family` but accessing `volume-family`
3. **Condition doesn't match**: `where target.instance.name = 'prod-*'` but instance is `dev-web-1`
4. **Propagation lag**: Policies take 10–60 seconds to take effect after creation/update

**Verb hierarchy** (each includes those below it):
```
inspect < read < use < manage
```

### Terraform and Resource Manager 403s

Before changing HCL, identify the principal and scope:

| Symptom | Check first |
| --- | --- |
| Terraform local apply gets 403 | API key user, session-token profile, identity-domain group mapping, and target resource policy |
| Terraform on Compute gets 403 | Instance dynamic group membership and policy on target resource family |
| Resource Manager stack/job gets 403 | `orm-*` permissions plus target service permissions in the target compartment |
| Resource Manager dynamic group cannot create VCN | Whether the principal is actually a Resource Manager/user context, and whether `manage virtual-network-family` is granted where the VCN is created |
| Identity-domain group can log in but cannot apply | Group mapping, exact group name, policy subject, compartment policy location |
| ZPR policy or security attributes cannot be managed | ZPR IAM permissions plus policy location and compartment scope |
| Bastion session creation is denied | Bastion/session permissions plus target resource/network permissions |

## Policy Syntax Gotchas

### Resource Type Families (Often Confused)

| Family | Includes | Common Mistake |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| `instance-family` | instances, console-connections, vnics, vnic-attachments | Does NOT include volumes |
| `volume-family` | volumes, volume-backups, volume-attachments | Separate from instance-family |
| `object-family` | buckets, objects | Objects are a separate resource type from buckets |
| `database-family` | db-systems, databases, autonomous-databases | Very broad — scope carefully |

### Conditions (WHERE clause)

```
# Tag-based
where target.resource.tag.environment = 'production'
where target.resource.freeform-tags.CostCenter = 'Engineering'

# Resource name (regex)
where target.instance.name =~ 'web-*'

# Request properties
where request.operation = 'LaunchInstance'

# Combined conditions
where all {target.resource.tag.env = 'prod', target.compartment.name = 'AppProd'}
where any {target.instance.shape = 'VM.Standard.E4.Flex', target.instance.shape = 'VM.Standard.A1.Flex'}
```

### Location Syntax

```
in compartment <name-or-ocid>          # Specific compartment only
in tenancy                             # Root — applies everywhere
in resource <resource-ocid>            # Rare; used for delegation
```

Note: there is no built-in syntax for "compartment + all descendants" — to cover a subtree, put the policy in the parent compartment.

## Dynamic Group Patterns

**By compartment** (most common — covers all current and future instances):
```
ALL {instance.compartment.id = '<compartment-ocid>'}
```

**By tag** (flexible — survives instance replacement):
```
ANY {instance.freeform-tags.app = 'webserver'}
```

**Restrictive AND rule** (production workloads):
```
ALL {instance.compartment.id = '<comp-ocid>', instance.freeform-tags.environment = 'production'}
```

### Testing Dynamic Group Membership

```bash
# 1. Get instance details (compartment + tags)
oci compute instance get --instance-id <instance-ocid>

# 2. Check dynamic group rule
oci iam dynamic-group get --dynamic-group-id <group-ocid>

# 3. Verify rule matches — if rule is "instance.compartment.id = X",
#    confirm the instance's compartment_id field equals X

# 4. Test from the instance (SSH in and run):
oci os ns get  # Works only if instance principal is correctly configured
```

## Authentication Methods

| Method | Use Case | Key Constraint |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **API Key** | Local dev, CI/CD outside OCI | Manual rotation required |
| **Instance Principal** | Apps on OCI compute | Only works on OCI compute |
| **Resource Principal** | OCI Functions, Data Flow | Limited to specific services |
| **Session Token** | Console federation via IDCS | Short-lived (~1 hour) |

## IDCS Federation Gotchas

- OCI group names must **exactly match** IDCS group names (case-sensitive)
- User can log in to console but can't see resources → Missing OCI IAM policy for the federated group
- "Invalid credentials" → IDCS federation not configured in OCI tenancy settings
- Group membership doesn't sync → OCI group name doesn't match IDCS group name

## Compartment Hierarchy Design

```
# WRONG: Flat structure — no IAM boundary between dev/prod
Tenancy
├─ Application1  (mix of dev/test/prod resources)
└─ SharedServices

# RIGHT: Environment-based hierarchy — clear blast radius, cost reporting
Tenancy
├─ Production
│  ├─ App1
│  └─ App2
├─ Development
│  ├─ App1
│  └─ App2
└─ SharedServices
   ├─ Networking
   └─ Security
```

## Progressive Loading Reference

Load [`references/oci-iam-policies-reference.md`](references/oci-iam-policies-reference.md) when:
- Writing complex policies with multiple conditions
- Need service-specific verbs and permission lists
- Troubleshooting policy evaluation order
- Implementing least-privilege access for a specific service

Do NOT load for quick syntax examples, troubleshooting 403/404, or dynamic group rules — this file covers those.

Load [`../infrastructure-as-code/references/oci-terraform-auth-matrix.md`](../infrastructure-as-code/references/oci-terraform-auth-matrix.md) when Terraform, OCI DevOps, Resource Manager, Compute instance principals, resource principals, OKE workload identity, Cloud Shell, or CI/CD federation affect the caller.

Load [`../zpr-security/references/zpr-reference.md`](../zpr-security/references/zpr-reference.md) when the IAM task is specifically about who may configure ZPR, security attributes, or ZPR policies.

Load [`../managed-bastion-access/references/managed-bastion-reference.md`](../managed-bastion-access/references/managed-bastion-reference.md) when the IAM task is specifically about who may create bastions, create sessions, update allowlists, or connect through OCI Bastion.
