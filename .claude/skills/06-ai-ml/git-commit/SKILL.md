# Git Commit

## Core Rule

Use direct `git` commands. This skill is scriptless by design.

If the user asks for a PR, draft PR, branch publication, or "publish", use
`yeet` instead. If the user says "commit and push" without PR language, ask
"PR or push-only?" and default to push-only when unclear. When the user
explicitly authorizes direct-to-main issue closure, use issue-closing commit
trailers such as `Closes #123` only after staging the intended paths and
verifying the diff.

## Trigger Cues

Use this skill for short or implicit commit-authoring asks such as:

- `commit`
- `commit this`
- `create a commit`
- `commit and push`
- `push-only`
- `stage only <paths> and commit`

If the request expands into branch publication or PR creation, route to `yeet`
instead of stretching this skill.

## Observable Command Baseline

Prefer the same command spine for most runs so commit work stays easy to audit
from session traces:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git diff -- <path>
git diff --staged
git add -- <explicit-paths>
git commit -F <message-file>
git log -1 --pretty=fuller
```

For push-only follow-through, append:

```bash
git push
```

## Workflow

1. Inspect the worktree with `git status --short --branch`.
2. Inspect relevant diffs with `git diff` and `git diff --staged`.
3. Stage only intended paths with explicit pathspecs such as
   `git add -- <path>`.
4. Re-check `git diff --staged` before committing.
5. Write a concise imperative subject and a body with summary, rationale, and
   validation.
6. Commit with `git commit -F <message-file>`.
7. Verify with `git status --short --branch` and
   `git log -1 --pretty=fuller`.
8. For push-only requests, use `git push` or `git push -u origin HEAD`.
