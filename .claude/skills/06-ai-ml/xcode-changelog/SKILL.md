# Xcode Changelog

## Goal

Resolve the active Xcode version, a user-requested version, or list the
available Apple Xcode Release Notes entries. For active local Xcode reports,
include the installed version's release notes and also include the latest
available release notes when that latest version is not installed.

## Runtime surface

- The supported runtime entrypoint is the shipped
  `scripts/print_xcode_changelog.py` helper inside this skill package.
- If your current working directory is the skill root, run it as
  `python3 scripts/print_xcode_changelog.py`.
- If you are invoking the skill from another repo, resolve the installed skill
  root first and run
  `python3 <xcode-changelog-skill-root>/scripts/print_xcode_changelog.py`.

## Trigger rules

- Use when the user asks for Xcode changelog details, Xcode release notes, or what changed in their current Xcode.
- Use when the user wants to compare their installed Xcode changelog against the latest available Apple release notes.
- Use when the user wants release notes for a specific Xcode version such as `26.4`, `26.5 beta`, or `16.4`.
- Use when the user asks which Xcode versions have release notes or wants the available Xcode release-note versions listed.
- Prefer this skill over ad-hoc browsing when the task is to match the active Xcode or a named version to Apple’s official release notes.

## Workflow

1. Run the shipped helper for the active local Xcode:
   `python3 <xcode-changelog-skill-root>/scripts/print_xcode_changelog.py`.
   The default report prints the installed Xcode release notes and, when the
   latest available Apple release-note entry is not installed, appends those
   latest release notes too.
2. If the user requested a specific version, run
   `python3 <xcode-changelog-skill-root>/scripts/print_xcode_changelog.py --version "<version label>"`.
3. If the user asked which versions are available, run
   `python3 <xcode-changelog-skill-root>/scripts/print_xcode_changelog.py --list`.
4. Share the single `Xcode` section printed by the script.
5. Preserve the `Source:` URL lines in the final answer for traceability.
6. If the script reports a normalized or fallback match, keep that explanation in the user-facing summary.

## Runtime Notes

- This skill is portable, but it requires macOS with `python3`, `xcodebuild`, `xcode-select`, `plutil`, and network access to Apple’s documentation.

## Script

- `scripts/print_xcode_changelog.py`: the shipped skill helper that resolves
  the active Xcode via local tooling, supports `--version` for explicit
  lookups and `--list` for index listings, fetches Apple’s official Xcode
  Release Notes index from the markdown-backed documentation endpoint, matches
  the best release-notes entry by title/version, and prints one `Xcode`
  section with either the cleaned installed note body, the installed notes plus
  latest available notes when the installed Xcode is behind, or the available
  version list plus source URLs.
